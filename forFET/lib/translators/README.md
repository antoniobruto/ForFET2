Translators from SpaceEx to HASLAC
===

We provide two translators that convert models written in [SpaceEx](http://spaceex.imag.fr/sites/default/files/spaceex_modeling_language_0.pdf) XML format to [HASLAC](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~bdcaa/ForFET/ref.pdf) language format. The first translator is written in **Matlab** and the second in **Octave**. 


#### Contents

In this folder, there exist four subfolders which contain:

1. The Matlab translator with a separate README
2. The Octave translator with a separate README
3. A list of SpaceEx models along with configuration files
4. The converted Haslac models


For information on how to install, run and use each of the translator, please read individual README instructions manuals.
